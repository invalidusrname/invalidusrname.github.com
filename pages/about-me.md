I'm a software engineer that specializes in modern web development.

I consult primarily on Ruby on Rails, database optimizations, and mobile application development. I've been known to take on LAMP stack projects as well.

When I'm not out on the trails or cycling in the countryside, you can find me on the first tuesday heading up the local [Ruby Hack Night](https://www.meetup.com/charlotte-rb) in Charlotte
