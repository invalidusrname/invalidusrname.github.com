Have an Ocotpress-powered site and want to show upcoming meetup.com events? Check out [meetup-octopress](https://github.com/invalidusrname/meetup-octopress). It's a work in progress, but good enough to display dates and event names in the sidebar for the [Charlotte Ruby User Group](http://www.charlotteruby.org).
