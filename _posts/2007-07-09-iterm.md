A must have app for shell fans. The default terminal for OS X is decent, but lacks tabs, bookmarks, and multiple profiles. iTerm includes all these missing features. I've been running iTerm since version .71 and finally upgraded to .95 today. It looks like a few bugs I've been waiting for to be fixed, i.e. better wrapping, have been. [Checks it out](http://iterm.sourceforge.net).
