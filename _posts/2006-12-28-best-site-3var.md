So I was reading through a couple of articles on Raganwald's [blog](http://weblog.raganwald.com), stumbling from link to link like I usually do, then something happened. Somehow I came across Java Developer's Journal. I took a snap of the site and thought I'd post it here for all readers (mainly me) to see.

This site is just horrible. Adverts are everywhere. There's even video advertisements playing right off the bat. They're just as bad as those punch the monkey flash ads. There would be no way you could actually read an article from this magazine online. It's like this gigantic disorganized mess of intarweb templated by a marketing monkey.

Thought I'd say more? Yeah, me too. I need to get back into this writing thing.
