They're usually not as good as the original, but I like these ones.


- Jimi Hendrix - All Along the Watchtower
- Social Distortion - Ring of Fire
- Chevelle - It's No Good
- Nirvana - Where Did You Sleep Last Night
- Sonic Youth - Superstar
- Jeff Buckley - Hallelujah
- Midtown - Suzanne
- Tegan & Sara - Dancing in the Dark
- Cat Power - How Can I Tell You
- The Postal Service - Against All Odds
- Rufus Wainright - Across the Universe

A nice, divisible number. 11.

Update: KCRW has their own album of [rare covers](http://www.kcrw.com/music/kcrw-cds/sounds-eclectic-the-covers-project) out as well
