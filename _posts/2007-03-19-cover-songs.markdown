They're usually not as good as the original, but I like these ones.

<ul>
<li>Jimi Hendrix - All Along the Watchtower</li>
<li>Social Distortion - Ring of Fire</li>
<li>Chevelle - It's No Good</li>
<li>Nirvana - Where Did You Sleep Last Night</li>
<li>Sonic Youth - Superstar</li>
<li>Jeff Buckley - Hallelujah</li>
<li>Midtown - Suzanne</li>
<li>Tegan & Sara - Dancing in the Dark</li>
<li>Cat Power - How Can I Tell You</li>
<li>The Postal Service - Against All Odds</li>
<li>Rufus Wainright - Across the Universe</li>
</ul>

A nice, divisible number. 11.

Update: KCRW has their own album of <a href="http://www.kcrw.com/music/kcrw-cds/sounds-eclectic-the-covers-project">rare covers</a> out as well
