So they've released PHP 4.4.6. Why? Do that many people still use 4? I suppose the only case where this would happen would be with IT people trying to steer away from the witchcraft that is OO and believe maintenance upgrades somehow supercede future additions to the language. (Comic book guy voice) Please to explain.

And if you're going to tell me 4 does have OO support, it blows.
